Raspberry Pi 3 with a small screen to display IP address and WiFi information 

I like to use Raspberry Pi to run some interesting code. But it is really annoying when I need to get the IP address info for SSH connection( I don't have monitor for my Pi). I am starting to think about show the network info through a small OLED screen it would be easy to work everywhere. then let's go get it.
